Customer Churn Prediction

Overview:

This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning (ML) models. Customer churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and reducing turnover.

Models Used:

1) Logistic Regression: A simple yet powerful statistical model used for binary classification tasks, ideal for predicting churn probability.

2) Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised ML model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes, used here for classifying churn status.

3) Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and handle overfitting.

4) k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm that classifies instances based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors, used for its simplicity and effectiveness in churn prediction.

Methodology:

1) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for model training.

2) Feature Selection: Identifying and selecting relevant features that significantly contribute to predicting customer churn.

3) Model Training: Training each ML model (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN) using the preprocessed data.

4) Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to determine their performance and reliability.

Results:

The project demonstrates that ensemble methods like Random Forest provide superior performance in predicting customer churn due to their ability to handle complex interactions between features. Logistic Regression and SVM also show strong performance, while KNN offers a straightforward approach with competitive results.

Conclusion:

This project successfully implements and compares different ML models for customer churn prediction. The findings indicate that ensemble and sophisticated models like Random Forest are highly effective, providing businesses with valuable insights to enhance customer retention strategies.

Future Work:

Future improvements could include:

Enhancing feature engineering to capture more customer behavior patterns.

Exploring additional advanced ML algorithms.

Integrating the prediction system into a customer relationship management (CRM) tool for real-time churn analysis.
